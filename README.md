# Volunteer-Management-System
 During the internship, I was tasked with multiple responsibilities, including the design and  implementation of the database schema, front-end forms for volunteer registration, and  back-end logic to process tasks and assignments. One of the key features of the system was  its role-based access, which allowed users to register as volunteers or be added directly by  the admin. Administrators were given enhanced control through the system’s ability to  create, edit, and delete events, as well as assign tasks to specific volunteers, improving  coordination and accountability within the organization.  Moreover, I introduced additional functionalities such as event editing, real-time task  assignment, and tracking of volunteer participation. This system not only improved the  organization’s ability to manage large-scale events but also significantly reduced the  administrative workload. Testing and iterative development played a key role in refining  the system, ensuring its usability and efficiency. The project culminated in a fully functional  platform that can be extended to include future enhancements, such as volunteer  notifications and automated reporting.  Through this internship, I enhanced my technical skills in web development, particularly in  the integration of back-end and front-end technologies. The experience has provided me  with a deeper understanding of how to design and implement systems that solve real-world  problems, ultimately contributing to the success of the organization’s mission.
